### Overview ###
This repository contains:
 - (1) a test time demonstration using a pre-trained colorization network (in IPython notebook)
 - (2) code for training a colorization network

### Clone this repository ###
Clone the master branch of the respository using `git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/richzhang/colorization.git`

### Dependencies ###
This code requires a working installation of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and basic Python libraries (numpy, pyplot, skimage, scipy). For guidelines and help with installation of Caffe, consult the [installation guide](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and [Caffe users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/caffe-users).

### (1) Test-Time Demo Usage ###
We include demo usage as an iPython notebook, under [`./demo/colorization_demo_v2.ipynb`](https://github.com/richzhang/colorization/blob/master/demo/colorization_demo_v2.ipynb). This IPython Notebook demonstrates how to use our colorization network to colorize a grayscale image. To run this, after cloning the directory, `cd` into the `demo` directory, run `ipython notebook` and open `colorization_demo_v2.ipynb` in your web browser.

### (2) Training Usage ###
The following contains instructions for training a colorization network from scratch. After cloning the repository, from the root directory:

(1) Run `./train/fetch_init_model.sh`. This will load model `./models/init_v2.caffemodel`. This model was obtained using the k-means initialization implemented in [Kraehenbuehl et al, ICLR 2016](https://github.com/philkr/magic_init).

(2) Run `./train/fetch_caffe.sh`. This will load a modified Caffe into directory `./caffe-colorization`. For guidelines and help with installation of Caffe, consult the [installation guide](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) and [Caffe users group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/caffe-users).

* Note that this is the same as vanilla-Caffe, with a `SoftmaxCrossEntropyLayer` layer added. You likely can add the layer to your current build of Caffe by adding the following files (found in the `./resources` directory) and re-compiling:
	`./src/caffe/layers/softmax_cross_entropy_loss_layer.cpp`
	`./src/caffe/layers/softmax_cross_entropy_loss_layer.cu`
	`./include/caffe/layers/softmax_cross_entropy_loss_layer.hpp`
If you do this, link your modified Caffe build as `./caffe-colorization` in the root directory and proceed.

(3) Add the `./resources/` directory (as an absolute path) to your system environment variable $PYTHONPATH. This directory contains custom Python layers.

(4) Modify paths in data layers `./models/colorization_train_val_v2.prototxt` to locate where ImageNet LMDB files are on your machine. These should be BGR images, non-mean centered, in [0,255].

(5) Run `./train/train_model.sh [GPU_ID]`, where `[GPU_ID]` is the gpu you choose to specify. Notes about training:

(a) Training completes around 450k iterations. Training is done on mirrored and randomly cropped 176x176 resolution images, with mini-batch size 40.

(b) Snapshots every 1000 iterations will be saved in `./train/models/colornet_iter_[ITERNUMBER].caffemodel` and `./train/models/colornet_iter_[ITERNUMBER].snapshot`.

(c) If training is interupted, resume training by running `./train/train_resume.sh ./train/models/colornet_iter_[ITERNUMBER].snapshot [GPU_ID]`, where `[ITERNUMBER]` is the last snapshotted model.

(d) Check validation loss by running `./val_model.sh ./train/models/colornet_iter_[ITERNUMBER].caffemodel [GPU_ID] 1000`, where [ITERNUMBER] is the model you would like to validate. This runs the first 10k imagenet validation images at full 256x256 resolution through the model. Validation loss on `colorization_release_v2.caffemodel` is 7715.

(e) Check model outputs by running the IPython notebook demo. Replace the release model with your snapshotted model.

(f) To download reference pre-trained model, run `./models/fetch_release_models.sh`. This will load reference model `./models/colorization_release_v2.caffemodel`. This model used to generate results in the [ECCV 2016 camera ready](arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf).

For completeness, this will also load model `./models/colorization_release_v2_norebal.caffemodel`, which is was trained without class rebalancing. This model will provide duller but "safer" colorizations. This will also load model `./models/colorization_release_v1.caffemodel`, which was used to generate the results in the [arXiv v1](arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511v1.pdf) paper.
